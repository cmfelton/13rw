Replication code for Felton working paper on 13 Reasons Why

To get all time series used in the analysis, run tgclean.do, suppclean.do, and then getcounts.R. analysis.R will produce all the plots and tables in both the main paper and Appendix B. sims.R will conduct the type-M, measurement error, and sample-splitting simulations. tgmisscount.do is for counting the number of observations before and after removing missing observations for the table in Appendix C.
